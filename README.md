# Calculus-as-a-Service API

A simple and flexible API for calculus operations: derivatives, integrals, optimizations, critical points, gradients, rate-of-change analysis, partial derivatives, and plotting for user-defined functions.  
Ideal for developers, analysts, engineers, educators, and anyone who wants to integrate calculus features into their applications without maintaining symbolic math libraries.

## 🚀 Features

- 🔹 Derivatives (symbolic and numeric)
- 🔹 Integrals (definite and indefinite)
- 🔹 Rate-of-change analysis (first and second derivatives at a point)
- 🔹 Optimization (find maxima/minima over a domain)
- 🔹 Critical points and concavity analysis
- 🔹 Partial derivatives and gradients for multivariable functions
- 🔹 Function plotting with image URLs

## 📥 Example usage

### Example 1: Optimize a function

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/optimize \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "function": "100*x - 2*x**2",
    "variable": "x",
    "domain": [0, 50]
  }'
```

Expected response:

```json
{
  "max_value": 1250.0,
  "at_x": 25.0,
  "explanation": "Maximum value of 1250.0 occurs at x = 25.0"
}
```

### Example 2: Compute derivative at a point

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/derivative \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "function": "3*x**2 + 2*x",
    "variable": "x",
    "order": 1,
    "at_point": 4
  }'
```

Expected response:

```json
{
  "derivative_order": 1,
  "value": 26.0,
  "at_point": 4.0,
  "expression": "6*x + 2",
  "explanation": "The 1-order derivative at x = 4.0 is approximately 26.0"
}
```
